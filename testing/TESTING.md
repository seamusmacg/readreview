## Usability 

Usability tests were carried out based on user stories as outlined in the README.md file. 

### User Story #1

>- As a user, I want to find books that I would like to read. 

The user is presented with a link to the catalogue immediately on landing on the home page. 

Callout Section: 

!["Callout Section with link to catalogue"](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/callout.PNG)

Catalogue Section: 

!["List of books shown to user"](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/catalogue.PNG)


### User Story #2

>As a user, I would like to leave a review for a book I read. If book doesn't exist, then submit it to the catalogue.

The user is presented with a review section for each book in the catalogue. Every book has a review form where a user can submit a review.

Review Section:

User can submit book if not in the catalogue

Book Submit Section:

## Responsiveness

The application was tested for responsiveness on multiple devices and browser using Developer Tools. Media queries and Materialize CSS  were used to keep the device responsive across different devices.
