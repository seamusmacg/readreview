### Project Overview
ReadReview is a book review website. Users can register and become users where they can submit books adding to the ReadReview catalogue. They can also leave reviews for existing titles. Books can deleted by admin or the user who submitted the book. Users can edit or delete reviews they submitted. The admin can delete or edit all reviews.


## UX 

### Strategy

#### User Stories
- As a user, I want to find books that I would like to read. 
- As a user, I would like to leave a review for a book I read. If book doesn't exist, then submit it to the catalogue.


### Scope and Features

### Features
- Home page - contains callout section which points to the catalogue which is the main feature of the site.  It also contains an About Section which explains the site
- Catalogue page - the primary functionality of the site is presented here. All the books in the catalogue are shown here including reviews submitted by users. It is on this page where users can interact with the catalogue - deleting. editing etc. 
- Profile - this page contains information about the user currently logged into the site.
- Submit Book - Here users can submit a book to the catalogue by filling out a form.
- Register - Visitors can register with the site by filling register form
- Login - Registered users can login with their credentials by filling out login form.
- Possible Future Features - Forum,  Downloadable PDF Ebooks, Rating System (Score out of ten)

### Structure 
The site is presented in a linear fashion with information presented on scrolling pages. The site is a minimum viable product which serves the basic needs of the user with a lot of room for future scaling in future releases. The site follows an intuitive design where key pieces are information are easily accessed by the user. It uses a familiar layout of navbar on top and footer on bottom that is easy to navigate and conforms to user expectations and standard practices.

### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) to create a wireframe for each event presented to the user. 

- [Home Page](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/readreview-home.png)
- [Catalogue Page](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/catalogue.PNG)
- [Register Page](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/readreview-register.png)
- [Login Page](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/readreview-login.png)
- [Submit Book Page](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/readreview-submit.png)
- [Profile Page](https://github.com/seamusmacg/readreview/blob/main/static/images/readreview-profile.png)

I maintained a consistent structure across the pages with many pages sharing similar features. 

### Colour 

- ![#00001](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00001/000000?text=+) `#00001`
- ![#722F37](https://via.placeholder.com/15/722F37/000000?text=+) `#722F37`
- ![#a27840](https://via.placeholder.com/15/a27840/000000?text=+) `#a27840`
- ![#8d5205](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8d5205/000000?text=+) `#8d5205`
- ![#FF0000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF0000/000000?text=+) `#FF0000`
- ![#008000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/008000/000000?text=+) `#008000`
- ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) `#FFFFFF`

The color theme I chose was inspired by decorative books you often see in libraries. These colors are usually a wine red, navy/blue, gold and silver. I used an assortment of these colors throughout the site to recreate that library look and feel.

Validation messages are displayed in the natural colours of green for success and red for errors.

### Typography

[Goudy Bookletter 1911](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goudy+Bookletter+1911) - used for all elements on the site.

I chose this font as I thought it matched well with the decorative book/library theme I was aiming for.

## Testing

The application was built using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Flask was used to run the site on localhost and to conduct testing throughout the development process.

### Validation 

I validated the HTML source code using the [HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org), there was a projection attribute in a link element which has been deprecated. I removed this.
Removed role from nav element as unnecessary.
Removed unused quotation mark from a tag.

The CSS passed without any errors - [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Manual Testing 

Testing was conducted on the finished application using Flask and Chrome Developer Tools. I also tested the application on different browsers. A full report on the manual testing process that tests functionality, usability, responsiveness and performance is available [here]().

## Major Bugs
- Unable to create a routes.py file in User directory. Solution : Delete routes.py for user and add route in main app.py
- Getting error "TypeError: Object of type 'ObjectId' is not JSON serializable" when creating a new user. Solution: create a JSON Encoder class
- Unable to prevent modal trigger when review form is empty. Solution: Create jquery to handle to click event and validate form.

## Deployment

The application was deployed through Heroku pages as follows:

1. Created a local repository on my local machine which included all the application files and directories. 
2. Initialized the repository through VS Code Source Control 
3. Created a repository on Github with same name. 
4. Staged and committed all the files with appropriate messages.
5. Manually deployed on Heroku
5. In Deploy section on Heroku, I retrieved the [live URL](https://read-review-project.herokuapp.com/).
